Basic & Major concepts:

API- Application Programming Interface:
-Majorly deals in communicating frontend with database (Business layer between frontend & Database- Just like a Waiter)

API/Web Services- Basically like JARS in Selenium we have- Can be downloaded whereas Web Services cannot be downloaded & you need to deal it online with various HTTPS methods

GET---
::Gets all the results as per the API (Involves main domain(like www.google.com)+uri(path like when you traverse between pages in an application)+parameters= anything after '?' is all parameters)- So provide all such details & response will be returned as per the Requests
:Params & headres can be sent in requests.get(api url, header='value',params='value')

::Status Code- 200 OK majorly for GET Requests
::Use- Used to retreieve all results like Search anything & the result obtained.

POST---
::This involve API URL with Body input needs- provide the details and get a response to valid with may be different content provided in raw input
::Status Code- 201 OK majorly for POST Requests
::Use- Used for creating new users

PUT---
::This is used for editing anything you desire- Entire data will be edited
::Status code is generally 200


DELETE
::Used to delete data
::Status code is 204 may be generally

--------------------------------------------
HOW TO REQUEST API?
:When you import requests package- Then this is majorly used to post the request for the above mentioned types
:This can then be stored into response variable & then asser the variable for:

:response.content,response.text,reponse.cookies like that multiple properties are associated & can be asserted


-------------------------------------------
How to input data from json file for REQUEST?
:json file is generally read for the inputs

f = open('file path)
json_request= json.loads(f.read())
Now this the request & use it the same way as above to validate the response

-For multiple data input, Another notepad has been updated
------------------------------------------
HOW TO VALIDATE AGAINST A SPECIFIC KEY VALUE FROM RESPONSE

:: For this , YOu need to use jsonpath (import jsonpath & syntax is)

x = jsonpath.jsonpath(your_request,'key_value')
This 'x' will contain a LIST so using indexing access the value & validate it accordingly
